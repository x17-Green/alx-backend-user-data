# ALX Backend User Data Project

This project is part of the ALX Backend curriculum and focuses on handling user data, including personally identifiable information (PII), encryption, and database authentication.

## Project Categories

The project is organized into several modules:

- [`0x00-personal_data`](./0x00-personal_data/README.md): Contains tasks related to handling PII data and logging.
- [`0x01-basic_auth`](./0x01-basic_auth/README.md): Focuses on basic authentication mechanisms.
- [`0x02-user_authentication_service`](./0x02-user_authentication_service/README.md): Deals with user authentication and integration with databases.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Identify and handle personally identifiable information (PII) in data.
- Implement logging mechanisms to record and obfuscate PII.
- Encrypt passwords and validate user inputs.
- Authenticate users to access databases using environment variables.

## Getting Started

Each module contains tasks with instructions on how to complete them. You can find the tasks in the respective directories.
